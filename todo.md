# WiseWattage - Energy Modelling Application

## **NOTE:** These entries are not guarantees for features, for more details in that area see the readme documentation. This is more of a running diary to track what ideas I want to test, or implementations that need finished/added to later. 


#### **TO DO LIST:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**
- Split SolarPVArray class further (PV Panel --> PV Array --> PV System --> PV Model).
- Update and expand existing module temperature modelling tools.
- Add wind speed and mounting structure into cell temperature calculations.

###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**
- Align SolarPV class variables with minimum details on the worst PV panel technical sheet, analyse data truly required for range of modelling.
- Combine & format raw module data for use in model. Ideally one csv sheet for each module type (solar, battery, etc.) regardless of data source.

###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**.
- Implement one-diode modelling method and compare to current methodology.
- Implement low irradiance and consider spectral losses.

#### **CURRENTLY BROKEN, NEEDS FIXED:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**


###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**
- Rename columns and class variables to simplify and make easier to read/interpret
