# WiseWattage - Energy Modelling Application

## **NOTE:** These entries are not guarantees for features, for more details in that area see the readme documentation. This is more of a running diary to track what ideas I want to test, or implementations that need finished/added to later. 


#### **TO DO LIST:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**
- Create seperate class for each model type to be run i.e. Solar_Demand, Solar_Grid etc. Make class variable across all models that can be used to access summary of combined results, etc.
- Create AC/DC generation and demand columns in model dataframe, ensures correct format when new generation 
methods are added.
- When adding battery, ensure calculation of efficiences occurs at each stage to account for variation in peak power demand effects on eff.


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**
- Complete and finalise wind turbine modelling & datasets
- Add battery storage to model

###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**.
-

#### **CURRENTLY BROKEN, NEEDS FIXED:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**


###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**
- Rename columns and class variables to simplify and make easier to read/interpret
