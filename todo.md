# WiseWattage - Energy Modelling Application

## **NOTE:** These entries are not guarantees for features, for more details in that area see the readme documentation. This is more of a running diary to track what ideas I want to test, or implementations that need finished/added to later. 


#### **TO DO LIST:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**.
- Add documentation to newly added code throughout, update readme and start main walkthrough/guide now that most of the modelling structure is finished.
- Add summaries, graphs and other grouping functions to main WW_Model
- Add financial parameter input and calculations to overall project/model
- Add additional functions to run multiple models to perform sensitivity analysis
- Add optimisation functions to allow user to input range of parameters that returns models based on optimised results


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**
- Create energy storage options as layers of classes i.e. Cell --> Battery--> Storage
- Create AC/DC generation and demand columns in model dataframe, ensures correct format when new generation 
methods are added. ???Potentially using net columns and tracking each component individually instead???
- Add wind turbines, AC/DC fuel generators

###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**.
- Add heat demand to modelling

#### **CURRENTLY BROKEN, NEEDS FIXED:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**


###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**
- Rename columns and class variables to simplify and make easier to read/interpret
