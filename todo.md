# WiseWattage - Energy Modelling Application

## **NOTE:** These entries are not guarantees for features, for more details in that area see the readme documentation. This is more of a running diary to track what ideas I want to test, or implementations that need finished/added to later. 


#### **TO DO LIST:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**
- Create energy storage options as layers of classes i.e. Cell --> Battery--> Storage
- Create AC/DC generation and demand columns in model dataframe, ensures correct format when new generation 
methods are added. ???Potentially using net columns instead???


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**
- Complete and finalise wind turbine modelling & datasets


###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**.
-

#### **CURRENTLY BROKEN, NEEDS FIXED:**
###### **HIGH PRIOIRTY**


###### **MEDIUM PRIOIRTY**


###### **LOW PRIOIRTY**
- Rename columns and class variables to simplify and make easier to read/interpret
