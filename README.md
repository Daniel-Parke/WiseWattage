# WiseWattage - Energy Modelling Application
### Demo: <URL HERE> **WORK IN PROGRESS, ONLINE APPLICATION WILL LAUNCH SOMETIME IN Q4 2024**
### Description
This project is an energy modeling application designed to model on and off-grid energy generation potential across various sites and system parameters. The long-term goal is to create an all-in-one energy model that will quickly and easily generate accurate model results and statistics. There are many paid energy models on the market that do a similar job, but I have found they almost always add complexity that is not required for the vast majority of scenarios, which adds to the development and modeling timeframes.

Solutions offered by paid software, like PVSyst, Homer, and Plexos, typically target challenges inherent to particular and unique scenarios. These are fantastic modelling packages; however, they often require a particular level of industry knowledge and expertise to use effectively. This, in turn, makes it difficult for those curious about optimizing their energy systems but don't have the time to master all the concepts.

It is these issues, among others, that I aim to address for the wider data science and energy community by hopefully providing energy modeling tools that are 99% as powerful as existing libraries but with 99% less complexity when using them. When completed, WiseWattage will hopefully be a complete package that can be used offline to create Class objects representing a range of energy modeling scenarios.

My particular personal bias is towards promoting hybrid on and off-grid energy systems, with a focus on optimizing system autonomy and economics in a combined approach. However, the modeling package will be able to be arranged for any system configuration or modeling parameters, whether a system dependent wholly on fossil fuels or renewable technologies.

The calculations behind the modeling are based on SAP methodologies, and documentation and referencing will be added once the project develops and methodologies have been finalized. Since I began experimenting with this project, I have changed the calculation methodology many times, and as such, I am reluctant to start formalizing the academic reporting until these areas are finalized.

Once this project has been completed, I will also hopefully utilize the same codebase to build an online application where users can generate their own solar PV models. This will be completed using Flask, Django, and/or FastAPI, offering basic API returns and a browser UI to run the model. Users will be prompted to create an account to save the model results for access later if they want, and they can generate an energy report summarizing the model created.

I am aiming to make the web app a free service indefinitely, with the long-term goal being to reduce the costs and time involved with energy modeling and assessments during the procurement phase of projects. I will initially be focusing on domestic scenarios first, but the model will be built with the ability to scale up or down indefinitely. WattSun & Homes will be the first implementation of an online application, which will focus on those in a domestic scenario interested in exploring the potential for rooftop Solar PV, and what other technologies could be incorporated. Hopefully this will offer the chance to gain invaluable feedback before the program is scaled up to include more complex scenarios.

## **Example of current implementation of model:**

The model is created by initializing Class objects which conduct the appropriate modeling when created. The models simulated can then be accessed using `.xxx` notation, with some basic time series data aggregation methods already built in. These models are returned as DataFrames, with the library being built with a focus on using it offline for personal data analysis.
<br>

```python
# Import required packages, assumes location is root of folder containing downloaded scripts.
from meteo.Site import Site
from solar.SolarPVArray import SolarPVArray
from solar.SolarPVModel import SolarPVModel

from misc.log_config import configure_logging

# Set up site and obtain TMY data
site = Site(latitude=54.60452, longitude=-5.92860)

# Set up PV arrays
pv_kwp = 1
surface_pitch = 35
surface_azimuth = -90
lifespan = 25
pv_eol_derating = 0.88

array_1 = SolarPVArray(pv_kwp, surface_pitch, surface_azimuth, lifespan, pv_eol_derating)
array_2 = SolarPVArray(1, 35, -45, 25, 0.88)
array_3 = SolarPVArray(1, 35, 0, 25, 0.88)
array_4 = SolarPVArray(1, 35, 45, 25, 0.88)
array_5 = SolarPVArray(1, 35, 90, 25, 0.88)
arrays = [array_1, array_2, array_3, array_4, array_5]

# Set up and run model
pv_model = SolarPVModel(site=site, arrays=arrays)
```
<br>

## Accessing Model Results

```python
# Example on how to access summary of model results
model_summary_df = pv_model.summary
model_summary_hourly_df = pv_model.summary_grouped.hourly
model_summary_daily_df = pv_model.summary_grouped.daily
model_summary_weekly_df = pv_model.summary_grouped.weekly
model_summary_monthly_df = pv_model.summary_grouped.monthly
model_summary_quarterly_df = pv_model.summary_grouped.quarterly

# Example on how to access specific model results
array_1_model_df = pv_model.models[0]["model_result"]
array_5_model_df = pv_model.models[4]["model_result"]

# Example on how to access combined model results
combined_model_df = pv_model.combined_model
```
This is an example implementation using basic inputs, however there are many more options for customising the model by adding additional inputs. These can be seen by looking into the specific functions called contained in the solar modelling .py files, and will be further detailed more as the project documentation improves over time.

- [ ] Inclusion of low irradiance losses
- [ ] Inclusion of spectral losses
- [ ] Inclusion of system/conversion losses
- [ ] Inclusion of base project financials to estimate cost for solar PV project
- [ ] Further statistical analysis functions to be added that target desired columns

###### **NOTE: We will not store accurate locations for areas being modelled after weather data has been returned, as this information is no longer required once TMY data is obtained. This is to improve user privacy and security in the event of any data breach. Ensuring and protecting user privacy will remain a core principle of this project as long as I am still involved in it's development.
